# Python Libraries Notes (For Data Analysis and NLP) ðŸ“š

This repository contains structured study notes, codes, and resources related to commonly used Python libraries for data analysis and NLP.

##  Topics Covered
-  Matplotlib
-  Numpy
-  Pandas
-  SpaCy
-  NetworkX

Almost each topic is organized into folders with the following structure:
topic-name/ â”œâ”€â”€ code/ â”œâ”€â”€ data/ â”œâ”€â”€ result/ â”œâ”€â”€ docs/

Inside the `docs/` folder, you'll often find a mind map I created myself. I highly recommend reading it first when starting a new library â€” it gives you a quick, intuitive overview.
